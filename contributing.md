## Ways to Contribute

## Bug Reports

If you've found a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/planetlabs/maps/issues) describing what you've found.  It is important that you include enough information for others reading the issue to be able to reproduce the problem. While it can take some time, if you can provide a [minimal reproducible example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example), it will increase the chances that someone else will be able to help solve the problem.

## Feature Requests

If you've got an idea for a new feature, please open an issue describing what you are thinking of. You should do this before writing any code or opening a pull request with your proposed changes. After discussion about your feature request on an issue, you can submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

## Documentation Improvements

We welcome any suggested improvements you may have for the project's documentation. You can submit a pull request for a documentation change without opening an issue first (as with feature requests above).
