title: 'Solar Terminator'
level: 2
description: |
  This example shows how the `<Vector>` source can be used to render a feature
  that is updated with changes to a component's state variables.  In this example
  a single feature is rendered with a polygon geometry representing the solar
  terminator (dark where it is night and light where it is day).

  The `day` and `hour` state variables are controlled by the sliders on the map.
  A `useEffect` hook is called when these values change to calculate a new polygon
  geometry representing the night.  The vector source is constructed with a single
  feature whose geometry is updated with this new polygon using the
  `feature.setGeometry()` method.
